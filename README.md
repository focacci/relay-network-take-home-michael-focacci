# About
This project was assigned to me by [George Tempel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgetempel/) as part of the interview process for the role of Software Engineer at [Relay Network](https://www.relaynetwork.com/).

My objective with this project is to demonstrate that my ability to plan, organize, and execute will provide exceptional value to the development team at Relay Network. 

As my prior experience with [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) is limited, this project is also a demonstration of my proficiency to learn independently via [documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) and tutorials on a tight deadline.

How I demonstrated such skills:
- Plan

    The first step I took in this process was thoroughly review the project requirements. It is imperative to have a complete understanding of my responsibilities and expectations at the beginning of the development process.

    Next I used Figma to draw a mock-up flow chart illustrating my end goal. This provides clarity on what specific components are required for the project, reducing the probability of unnecessary complexity.

- Organize

    Because this project was broken down into five (5) steps, I created milestone labels for Steps 1 - 5 on GitHub. Each milestone had an associated planned deadline, allowing myself (and any hypothetical contributors) to understand the timeframe in which we are working.

    Before writing any code, I enumerated my planned steps as GitHub Issues. Each Issue was tagged with its associated milestone, type (bug, documentation, enhancement, etc), and assignee. Issues would be closed once completed.
    
    I also used a professional branching scheme that I had learned at University in my capstone course. `dev` branched off of `main`, containing all complete features ready for next release. Off of `dev` spawned branches for each feature (milestone) such as `step-1`, `step-2`, etc, and hotfixes with an informative name and the associated Issue number (such as `eslint-warnings-issue#18`).

    All of my commits were localized to a specific Issue, with informative messages describing my change and a reference to its Issue number.

- Execute

    After planning my approach, I chipped away at the project one Issue at a time. Each commit was preceeded by a local test run, where I ensure the project compiled without error and displayed as expected in my browser.

    Each day I completed a new step, each one completed on time per my schedule.

    Before submission, I double and triple-checked every requirement and ensured they were completed to the best of my ability.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
